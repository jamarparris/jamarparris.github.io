		<p>Let me begin by saying that I love travel. This year alone I&rsquo;ve been to London, Barcelona, Hong Kong, Macau and Japan internationally and San Francisco domestically. One of the biggest things that stresses me out everytime I travel is trying to figure out a seamless way to stay connected.</p>

<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;ll keep this post short. The best device for international travel is the new iPhone. It supports <a href='http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/' target='_blank'>16+ LTE bands</a> meaning near ubiquitous worldwide compatability. Samsung, by comparison tailors the LTE and 3G support in their phones to each carrier and geography, meaning far less global support.</p>

<p>In terms of which carrier to choose, it gets more complex but here are 5 scenarios:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Can&rsquo;t be bothered with the hassle of getting a local SIM card in countries you vist?</strong>
Go with T-Mobile. They offer <a href='http://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans/simple-choice-international-plan-countries.html' target='_blank'>free data roaming</a> to their customers. It&rsquo;s only 2G speed but it&rsquo;s better than nothing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Price sensitive and looking to sign a contract to keep costs down?</strong>
Go with Verizon. They&rsquo;re the only carrier whose on contract devices come unlocked out of the box meaning you can seek out a local SIM card and use it without fear.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Willing to pay full price for your iPhone ($649+)?</strong>
Ultimate flexability. Go with your carrier of choice. It&rsquo;ll come unlocked in all cases assuming you buy it directly from the Apple Store (note: probably not from the carriers though).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do you travel to China alot?</strong>
Get the Sprint model, it&rsquo;s adds 4 more LTE bands popular with China&rsquo;s biggest carriers. On the other models, you should still get decent coverage but you&rsquo;ll have fewer options in terms of local carriers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do you live outside the US?</strong>
Then you only have one model to choose! Go with it!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Happy Jetsetting!</p>

		<p>When you&rsquo;re in your 20s and 30s, saving doesn&rsquo;t sound like much fun and retirement especially can feel like this thing that&rsquo;s too far away to matter right now. I&rsquo;ve noticed a certain level of ambivalnce among people in my age group towards personal finance. Some people either ignore it entirely (very bad) or they blindly set aside money without setting goals or doing the research and follow up necessary to ensure they stay on track (better, but not by much).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not expecting everyone to become finance experts but I do believe everyone should take the time to learn something about financial management as it&rsquo;s something that only gets increasingly complex with age once things such as mortgages, kids and other expenses become more commonplace in our lives.</p>

<p>Things everyone in their 20s/30s should know about:</p>

<ul>
<li> 401K/IRA accounts - the hidden fees you pay, what is a Roth versus a Traditional account?</li>
<li> Credit Scores - how they impact you</li>
<li> Emergency Funds - helps with job loss and medical emergencies</li>
<li> Credit Cards - Responsible use and how they can benefit your credit score</li>
<li> Saving for other goals (travel, education)</li>
</ul>


<p>Is there alot above to take in? Yes, it can seem daunting but our generation is used to consuming (and generating) massive amounts of data each day on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.</p>

<p>Surely, we&rsquo;re up for the task, if only more people were interested.</p>

				The Urgency of Side Projects</a>

		<p>I came across 2 great articles this morning. One about the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3032394/hit-the-ground-running/spotifys-design-lead-on-why-side-projects-should-be-stupid" target="_blank">importance of side projects</a> and another about having a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/85broads/2014/06/20/can-leadership-urgency-be-taught/" target="_blank">culture of leadership urgency.</a></p>

<p>It got me thinking about my own side projects and how they seem to create a sense of urgency within me. Working on my own little ideas motivates and drives me in ways that few other things can. That sense of complete ownership of something at all stages of development (including conception, design, coding and release) can lead me to work on them all weekend and spend most of my evenings outside of work hacking on them.</p>

<p>Most of these side projects aren&rsquo;t large. Their small focus makes them approachable and fun. Their size also makes it easy to start hacking away at another idea if I lose passion for the current one (i.e. it becomes less urgent). I&rsquo;m not too focused on the sunk cost in terms of time and effort because that outlay is generally minimal.</p>

<p>That being said, companies could do well to focus less on sunk costs regardless of how large an item they are. Many people understand what a sunk cost is, but few are able to make decisions without factoring them into the discussion in some way. Learning from the past is very different from being bound to it.</p>

<p>It should also come as no surprise to those who know me that most of my side projects are travel focused. I absolutely love the travel space, spending hours focusing on future trips, everything from deciding where to go, how to get a good deal and then ensuring a great in-trip experience. I can probably rattle off a list of 10-15 travel related projects that I&rsquo;d like to build over time.</p>

<p>Regardless of their small size, every project involves learning something new, whether it be researching an interesting vertical, learning to use a new design tool, developing in a new programming language or interacting with a new API. My knowledge of travel tech, iOS, Passbook, Python, NodeJS and Omnigraffle have all come from side projects.</p>

<p>Some of these projects are never updated past their initial release, some I completely shut down over time and others I maintain with small fixes here and there. Regardless of their eventual fate, with a new skill or 2 added to my toolbox each time, their impact on my knowledge and my career path is great. I hope I never lose that sense of urgency.</p>

		<p>I&rsquo;d long been a believer in owning your online presence. Because of this I bought my namesake domain back in 2007 (along with some domains for my younger siblings).</p>

<p>The reason for this is simple: permanence.</p>

<p>Even if you use a popular hosting, blogging or email service behind the scenes, having that content point to a domain you control ensures that your content lives on beyond the life of any single 3rd party service provider.</p>

<p>For the $10 a year it costs to own a domain, this is more than worth it.</p>
