Let me begin by saying that I love travel. This year alone I've been to London, Barcelona, Hong Kong, Macau and Japan internationally and San Francisco domestically. One of the biggest things that stresses me out everytime I travel is trying to figure out a seamless way to stay connected. Given this, I've done quite a bit of research and this blog post details what I've found.

The best device for international travel is the <a href='http://www.apple.com/iphone-6/' target='_blank'>new iPhone</a>. It supports <a href='http://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/' target='_blank'>16+ LTE bands</a> meaning near ubiquitous worldwide compatability. Samsung, by comparison tailors the LTE and 3G support in their phones to each carrier and geography, meaning far less global support.

In terms of which carrier to choose, it gets more complex but here are 5 scenarios:

1. **Can't be bothered with the hassle of getting a local SIM card in countries you visit?**
Go with T-Mobile. They offer <a href='http://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans/simple-choice-international-plan-countries.html' target='_blank'>free data roaming</a> to their customers. It's only 2G speed but it's better than nothing.

2. **Price sensitive and looking to sign a contract to keep costs down?**
Go with Verizon. They're the only carrier whose on-contract devices come unlocked out of the box, meaning you can seek out a local SIM card and use it without fear.

3. **Willing to pay full price for your iPhone ($649+)?**
Ultimate flexability. Go with your carrier of choice. It'll come unlocked in all cases assuming you buy it directly from the Apple Store (note: probably not from the carriers though).

4. **Do you travel to China alot?**
Get the Sprint model, it's adds 4 more LTE bands popular with China's biggest carriers. On the other models, you should still get decent coverage but you'll have fewer options in terms of local carriers.

5. **Do you live outside the US?**
Then you only have one model to choose! Go with it!

Happy Jetsetting!
