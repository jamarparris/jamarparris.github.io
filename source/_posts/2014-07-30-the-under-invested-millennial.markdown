When you're in your 20s and 30s, saving doesn't sound like much fun and retirement especially can feel like this thing that's too far away to matter right now. I've noticed a certain level of ambivalnce among people in my age group towards personal finance. Some people either ignore it entirely (very bad) or they blindly set aside money without setting goals or doing the research and follow up necessary to ensure they stay on track (better, but not by much).

I'm not expecting everyone to become finance experts but I do believe everyone should take the time to learn something about financial management as it's something that only gets increasingly complex with age once things such as mortgages, kids and other expenses become more commonplace in our lives.

Things everyone in their 20s/30s should know about:
<ul>
<li> 401K/IRA accounts - the hidden fees you pay, what is a Roth versus a Traditional account?</li>
<li> Credit Scores - how they impact you</li>
<li> Emergency Funds - helps with job loss and medical emergencies</li>
<li> Credit Cards - Responsible use and how they can benefit your credit score</li>
<li> Saving for other goals (travel, education)</li>
</ul>

Is there alot above to take in? Yes, it can seem daunting but our generation is used to consuming (and generating) massive amounts of data each day on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Surely, we're up for the task, if only more people were interested.
