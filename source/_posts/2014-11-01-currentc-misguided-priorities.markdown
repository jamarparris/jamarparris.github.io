Much has been said about <a href="http://currentc.com/" target="_blank">MCX/CurrentC</a> and it's attempt to block ApplePay (and other NFC based wallets like Google Wallet) from member stores, so I won't rethread well worn ground except to saying the following:

MCX (in it's current form) represents a terrible customer experience with significant privacy and security ramifications due to retailers capturing your <a href="https://twitter.com/hasanahmad80/status/526551322523623424" target="_blank">social security number and  drivers license</a>, plus <a href="https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/currentc-data-collected.png?w=680&h=332" target="_blank">health and medical information</a>, not to mention making you liable for any fraudulent transactions on your checking account (while themselves <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/29/retailer-backed-apple-pay-rival-currentc-has-been-hacked-testers-email-addresses-stolen/" target="_blank">already having been hacked</a>). We've seen this story before, where incumbents create half-baked solutions in an attempt to fight off a new challenger. That always works out well right? Remember Blockbuster and their (at best) meh attempt at trying to compete with Netflix?

Moving on...

One thing not mentioned that much about MCX though, is that in my opinion, it informs on how misguided their priorities are. ApplePay does not in itself represent an existential threat to these companies. It is at most a distraction away from the much bigger looming threats out there, particularly Amazon, but also other companies like Google, Alibaba and some other company that probably doesn't even exist yet. Their brand and focus on user experience will make them formidable foes.

All of the resources, time and effort being put into MCX would be much better spent elsewhere. Instead, what we get right now is a customer unfriendly product that even before launch is building negative brand equity with a demographic that they should be doing everything to attract. It makes me wonder if they even have a chance at fighting off the more serious challenges to come.
