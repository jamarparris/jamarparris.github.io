I'd long been a believer in owning your online presence. Because of this I bought my namesake domain back in 2007 (along with some domains for my younger siblings).

The reason for this is simple: permanence.

Even if you use a popular hosting, blogging or email service behind the scenes, having that content point to a domain you control ensures that your content lives on beyond the life of any single 3rd party service provider.

For the $10 a year it costs to own a domain, this is more than worth it.
