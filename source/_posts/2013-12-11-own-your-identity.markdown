I'd long been a believer in owning your online presence. Because of this I bought my namesake domain back in 2007 (along with some domains for my younger siblings). 

The reason for this is simple: permanence.

Even if you use a popular hosting, blogging or email service behind the scenes, having that content point to a domain you control ensures that you can ensure your content lives on beyond the life of any single service.

For $10 a year, this is more than worth it.
