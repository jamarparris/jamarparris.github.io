This was certainly a busy week for Apple. They announced new iPhones, an entirely new payment mechanism for their phones and added an entirely new product class to it's offerings.

iPhone
______

Hardware wise, the new iPhones are now more evolutionary than revolutionary. That is not a bad thing at all, especially as the performance and other improvements under the hood seem quite significant. This revision round seems much less about any individual product and much more about the ecosystem as a whole. Apple is pushing the fact that their products are better together. We see this with features like Continuity and iCloud Drive for iOS and Mac OS X Yosemite. The truly exciting things in my mind are yet to come, we'll soon see what developers do with their increased abilities on things like extensions, HomeKit, HealtKit and Metal. There's probably never been a better time to be an Apple developer than now.

Apple Watch
-----------
Again continuting on the better together approach, the Apple Watch requires iPhone to function. This makes sense for a variety of reasons, especially given that it enables the device to offload hard work to his partner and probably helps keep the device slimmer than it otherwise would be. The user interface on AppleWatch is certainly quite different from iOS. It's the biggest deviation yet that we've seen across products running iOS in some form whether it be an iPad or Apple TV. I liked everything I saw, which admittedly wasn't as much as I would like as Apple left out some crucial information from their announcement, most importantly battery life. It stands to reason that this product will evolve and advance rapidly given it's nascent stage compared to more established products like the iPhone.

Apple Pay
---------
People focused alot on in-store here but I think the most exciting part of this is for online commerce.
